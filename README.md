This project explores the metabolic costs associated with maintaining sexually selected weapons in insects. 
Insect Model used: Leptoscelis tricolor

Data used was in a CSV format and included the following columns:

*ID* _ an id for each individual insect. (All insects were male)
*Avg_Hind_Leg_Mass* _mass both hind legs/2 (g)
*Pre_MR_Avg* _Metabolic rate calculated from CO2 production averaged from
periods of low activity, for each individual before leg loss
*Post_MR_Avg* _Metabolic rate calculated CO2 production averaged from
periods of low activity, for each individual 24 hours after leg loss
*Size* _size categories for males, small, medium or large

Two scatterplots were produced. 
Plot 1: Hind Leg Mass vs. Metabolic Rate Before Leg Loss
Results of the plot shows small hind legs to have lower metabolic rates, while medium legs have intermediate metabolic rates with large legs having high metabolic rates.
Smaller hind leg masses could indicate lower metabolic costs, since the weapon (the hind legs) is smaller, thus requiring less energy to maintain.
Medium hind leg masses might reflect intermediate metabolic costs.
Larger hind leg masses (which are energetically expensive to maintain) might show the highest metabolic rates.
Plot 2: Hind Leg Mass vs. Metabolic Rate After Leg Loss
Results of the plot show a more spread out plot with less of a relationship, which suggests that metabolic rate is affected by hind leg loss. 

It is clear that there are in fact metabolic costs associated with maintaining sexually selected weapons in insects.
